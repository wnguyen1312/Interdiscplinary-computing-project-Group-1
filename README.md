This file is mainly used to describe the work done by group 1
## Introduction
This project is mainly focused on finding the optimal lens in different conditions (myopia or hyperopia) based on optimisation.

## Contribution
Writing and testing the code: William Nguyen and Jingheng Peng.
Research and poster presentation: Shreya Sridharan and Oliver Lam.

## Assumption
1. Constant refractive indicies in the material (no dispersion).
2. Geometrical ray tracing holds (investigated length >> diffraction limit) 


## Background

Hyperopia (far-sightedness) and myopia (near-sightedness) are two of the most common vision problems. They affect approximately 30% and 25% of people worldwide. They are both caused by refractive errors that affect the eyeâ€™s ability to correctly focus light at the retina, causing blurriness [1]. 
In myopia, the eye is too long or the cornea is too steep, which causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. This results in distant objects appearing blurry while close-up objects appear clear. See figure 1 (a)
In hyperopia, the opposite occurs, where the eye is too short or the cornea is too flat, causing light to focus behind the retina instead of directly on it. This results in close-up objects appearing blurry while distant objects appear clear. (See figure 1 b)

Risk factors for both include age, genetics, and other underlying health conditions. Both can be treated using refractive surgery or orthokeratology; however, the most common method is using corrective lens in the form of glasses or contact lens. The lenses work by changing the way that light is refracted as it enters the eye, allowing it to focus directly on the retina. See Figure 2 and 3

The different parameters important for the lens are curvature, thickness and refractive index. 

Spherical lens can suffer from spherical aberrations if the rays are not paraxial. Aberrations mean that highly deviated rays (i.e not paraxial) do not focus at the expected focal points. One way to counter this is through the use of adaptive optics, which involves essentially deforming the original spherical shapes. In terms of optimisation, we would measure the level of aberrations with the RMS spot size. The smaller the RMS spot size, the more focus your image is. The RMS spot size is found by tracing multiple rays through the system and working out the associated RMS value. Then, we will use some optimising routine from Scipy to obtain the deformation parameters to obtain the minimum RMS spot size. For a large number of parameters (I.e multiple lens / imaging system), we want to use the Nelder-Mead method, which is more robust as it is not gradient based.
